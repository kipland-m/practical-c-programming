/*
Write a program to perform date arithmetic such as how many days there are between 6/6/90 and 4/3/92. Include a specification and a code design.

Date arithmetic has always baffled me.
How am I supposed to translate this to number of days?

Lets start small.

How many days are between 6/6/90 and 7/4/90?

To determine if a year is a leap year, you can divide it by 4. If it's evenly divisible by 4, it's a leap year. However, if the year is also divisible by 100, you need to check if it's also divisible by 400.

// array of 12 integers that represent the amount of days in each month
int year[12];

int main(){
  return (0);
}
